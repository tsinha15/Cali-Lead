# Cali-Lead
A morsel of code using the Mapbox API to map the amount of lead contamination in California's counties
The map has been formatted in a scatter plot in order to showcase the ability to plot coordinates point by point- useful when trying to "connect the dots" in order to find a source of lead contamination
This code is a prototype example
